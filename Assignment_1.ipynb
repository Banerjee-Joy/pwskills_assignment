    "        -> Python supports multiple programming paradigms like structred, object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
    "        -> Python codes are easy to debug as it is an interpreted language.\n",
    "        -> Python is easy to learn for its simplicity in reading and writing.\n",
    "        -> Python has extensive support libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib that makes it suitable for scientific and data-related applications.\n",
